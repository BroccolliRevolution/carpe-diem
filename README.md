This is just a tiny hobby project which initially supposed to replace Habitica for me.

Right now I'm the only user, hard to tell if anyone else could find some use. But I'll make it sure she/he will be welcome to do that.

Once I'm finished with it anyway, since this is still now just **WIP**

The project is created to make me stick to the useful habits and to avoid procrastination as much as possible. Not by beating myself for not making it, but rather by using motivation if possible.

Even though it seems quite basic, it really helps me in my day-to-day life. I found it more useful for my porposes than Habitica.
